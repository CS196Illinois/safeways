Safeways is a webapp that maps the safest route from one place to another by accounting for recent and frequent crime locations in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus area. 

# Description
Using data provided by the <a href="https://moto.data.socrata.com/dataset/University-of-Illinois-Police-Department/3h5f-6xbh">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign police department</a>, this web app shows routes from point A to point B that avoid dangerous spots around campus. These spots include places where crime has happened within the last six months as well as places where crimes have happened frequently in the past few years.
